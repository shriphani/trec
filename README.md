# TREC Federated Search Clueweb

## Dataset:

location: /bos/tmp17/gzheng/FedWeb

observations: In FW14, 10 results per query and all snippets have associated html documents (what to do if results are jpeg or such?)

Guoqing: Aren't JPEGs just thumbs of the pages?

## Plan:

* Build indri indices for all collections
* Implement winning idea for 2013.
* REDDE/CORI etc because whatever.

## Misc:

Indri API: http://www.lemurproject.org/doxygen/lemur/html/classindri_1_1api_1_1QueryEnvironment.html#a26
